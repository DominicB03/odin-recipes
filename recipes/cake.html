    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 ounces dark chocolate bar or bittersweet baking chocolate bar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Fold a piece of parchment paper in half, then half again to get four layers. Trace the bottom of a ramekin on the parchment and cut out 4 circles. Use butter to grease the bottom and sides of ramekins. Place the parchment circles into the bottom of the ramekins and grease the parchment paper as well.</li>
        <li>Slice the butter into pieces and break the chocolate into small pieces. Place them in a glass measuring cup or glass bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds, stir, and then microwave another 20 to 40 seconds until completely melted when stirred. Allow to cool while you make the rest of the batter.</li>
        <li>In a larger bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk until fully combined and frothy. Then whisk in the dry ingredients and the milk. Whisk until smooth, then slowly add butter and chocolate mixture and whisk until just incorporated and smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly into four ramekins. Place ramekins on a baking sheet and bake them for 11 minutes. The cake should be risen, cracked across the top and just a little bit jiggly when the center is lightly tapped with your finger.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and rest the cakes for 2 minutes. Carefully run a sharp paring knife around the outsides of the cake to let it loose from the ramekin. Using a hot pad, invert one lava cake onto a plate. Wait 10 seconds before carefully removing the ramekin to unmold the cake, then remove the parchment circle from the top.</li>
        <li>Dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately, using a spoon to open the cake and allow the lava to flow out.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
